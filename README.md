# Image-Classifier
Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project. Specifically, image classification comes under the computer vision project category.

In this project, we will build a convolution neural network in Keras with python on a CIFAR-10 dataset. First, we will explore our dataset, 
and then we will train our neural network using python and Keras.
